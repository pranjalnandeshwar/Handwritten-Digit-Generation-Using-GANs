# Handwritten-Digit-Generation-Using-GANs

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project is a great starting point for learning about GANs, covering their fundamental concepts and providing hands-on experience with deep learning and image generation.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Generates new data instances that resemble the training data.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates the authenticity of the generated data.

These two networks are trained simultaneously: the generator learns to create more realistic images, while the discriminator improves at distinguishing real images from fake ones. The goal is to train the generator to produce images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real images.
